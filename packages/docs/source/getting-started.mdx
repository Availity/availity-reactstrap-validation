## About the Project

This library contains helper components that extend the form capabilities provided by reactstrap. The library does not depend on jQuery or Bootstrap javascript, only reactstrap.

Use the form and input components provided by this library directly instead of the ones provided by reactstrap. You can use the components provided by reactstrap in conjunction with the components this library provides without an problem, but validation will not work for those particular components.
